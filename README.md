# 01 — Data Frame (R)

This module builds intuition for R **data frames** with short, practical exercises.

## Topics covered
- Create a data frame
- Select rows/columns (indexing)
- Add/modify columns
- Filter with conditions
- Summaries/statistics
- Sorting
- Combining data frames (`rbind`)

## Files
- `dataframe_problems.R` — problems with `# TODO` sections
- `dataframe_solutions.R` — full worked solutions

Run either file in R/RStudio. Start with `dataframe_problems.R` and try to solve before peeking at solutions.
